## General Information

### Problem Statement
_*BoomBikes*_, a bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. BoomBikes aspires to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

The business goal is to model the demand for shared bikes, understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.
